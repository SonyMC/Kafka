----------------------------------

Kafka KRaft
-------------
- in 2020, Apache Kafka project started work to remove teh Zookeer dependency for itz( KIP-500)
- Zookeeper shows scaling issues when Kafka clusters have > 100,000 parttions
- By Removing Zookeeper, Apache Kafka can:
	- Scale to millions of parttions, and become easier to maintain and setup
	- Improve stability, makes it easier to monitor, supoort and administer
	- Single security model for whole system 
	- Single process to start with Kafka
	- Faster controller shutdown and recovery time

- Kafka 3.X now implements the Raft protocol(kRaft) in order to replace Zookeeper
