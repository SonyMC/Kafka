Get Taxi 
---------

- Is a company that allows people to match with taxi drivers on demand, right away. The business wants the following capabilites:
	-user should match with a close by driver 
	-the pricing should surge if no.of drivers are low or no. of users are high
	- all the position data before and durign the ride should be stored in an analytics store so that the cost can be computed accurately 



How to implement
---------------


- New Topic : 
	-user position 
		- high volume of data
		- > 30 parttions
		- multiple producers
		- key = user_id"
		- data is ephemeral and does not need ot kept for long time in Kafka 
	-taxi position 
		- high volume of data
		- > 30 parttions
		- multiple producers
		- key = "taxi id"
		- data is ephemeral and does not need ot kept for long time in Kafka 
	-surge pricing 
		- high volume of data
		- regional
	
	 


- Producer:
	- User Postion Service  :  which sends user location to the topic ' user position' 
	- TAxi position service : 	sends taxi location to topic 'taxi posotion'	


-Kafka Stream:
	- Can take inputs from multiple topics and produce computation on them
	- Surge Pricing Computational Model( Kafka Stream)
		- takes dat from topics 'user position' & 'taxi position' and writes to topic 'surge pricing' 
	=- Other topics such as 'weather' and 'events' can be included to increas the efficiency of the computation model

- Consumer: 
	- Taxi cost service :
		- takes data from topic 'Surge PRicing'

- KAfa Connect:
	- take sinput from topics 'user position' & 'taxi position' and stores it day Amazon S3.
