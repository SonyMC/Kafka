Topic Replication
----------------

- Topics should have a replication factor > 1( usually between 2 & 3) 
- That way if a broker is down, another broker can serve the data 
- E.g.: Topic A with 2 partitions and replication factor of 2:
	-  For 3 brokers:
		- Topic A parttition 0 and 1 will be replicated once ( two copies) across the brokers

Topic Replication Factor
--------------------
- Evenif one beoker is down, data willeb server from remaining brokers


Concept of Leader for a Partition
----------------------------------
- At any one time one ONE broker can be a leader for a given parttion 
- Producers can only send data to the broker that is a leader of the partition
- Therefore each partition has one leader and multiple ISR(In-Sync Replica)


Default producer & consumer behaviour with leaders
---------------------------------------------------
- Kafka producers can only write to the leader broker for a parttion
- Kafka consumers by default will read from leader broker for a partition 


Kafka Consumers Replica Fetching(Kafka v2.4+)
--------------------------------------------------
- Sicne Kafka 2.4,it is possible to configure consumers to read from closest(location wise) replica to decrease latency
