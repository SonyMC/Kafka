Wikimedia Producer - Message Compresion
--------------------------------------------------

Refer : https://blog.cloudflare.com/squeezing-the-firehose/


- Producer usually sends that is text based , for E.g. JJSON data
- In this case, it is important to apply compression to teh producer.
- Compression can be enabled at the Producer level and doesn't require any configuration changes in the Brokers and the Consumers
- Compression.type can be:
	- none(default)
	- gzip
	- lz4
	- snappy
	- zstd(from Kafka 2.1)

- Compression is more effective the bigger the batch of message being sen tto KAfka
- Advantages:
	- Much smaller producer request size(compression ratio upto 4x) 
	- Faster to transfer data over the N/W 	=> less latency 
	- Better throughput
	- Better disk utilization in Kafka( stored message son disk are smaller)
- Disadvantages( very minor):
	- Producer must commit some CPU cycles to compression
	- Consumers must also commit some CPU cycles for decompression
- Overall:
	- Consider testing 'snappy' or 'lz4' for optimal speed/compression ratio( test others too)
	- Consider tweaking 'linger.ms' and 'batch.size' to have bigger batches , and therefore more compession and higher output
	- Use compression in production   


	


Message Compression at Broker/Topic level:
--------------------------------------------

	- compression.type=producer
		- default setting
		- the broker takes teh compressed batch from thw producer client and writes it direclty to the topic's log file 	without compressing the data

	- There is also a setting you can set at the broker level( all-topics) or topic level

	- compression.type=none
		- all batches are decompressed by the broker

- You can set a specific type of compression:
		- E.g. compression.type=lz4	
			- If it is matching with the producer setting, data is stored on disk as is 
			- If it's a different compression setting than that of the producer, batches are decompressed by the broker and then re-compressed using the compression algorithm specified

- Warning: If you enable broker side compression, it will consume extra CPU cycles
