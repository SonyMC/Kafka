Wikimedia Producer - Producer Retries 
--------------------------------------

- In case of transient failures , developers are expected to handle exceptions, otherwise data will eb lost
- Example of transient failure:
	- NOT_ENOUGH_REPLICAS(due to min.insync.replicas setting)

- There is a "retries" setting:
	- defaults tto 0 for Kafka <= 2.0
	- defaults to 2147483647 for 

- The retty.backoff.ms setting is by default 100ms
	- How much time to wait before retrying

Producer Timeouts
------------------
- If retries>0, retries are bonded by a timeout
- Since Kafka 2.1, you ca set: delivery.timeout.ms=120000==2min
- Records will eb failed if they can't be acknowledged within delivery.timeout.ms
- If you are not using idempotent producer(not recommended- old Kafka) :
	- In case of retries, there is a chance that messages will be sent outof order(if a batch has failed to besent)
	- If you rely on key based ordering, that can be an issue

- For this, you can set the setting while controls how many produce requests can be made in parallel
	-max.in.flight.requests.per.connection
	- Default: 5
 	- Set it to 1 if you need to ensure ordering( may impact throughput)

- In Kafka >= 1.0.0, there's a better soltutin with idempotent producers
