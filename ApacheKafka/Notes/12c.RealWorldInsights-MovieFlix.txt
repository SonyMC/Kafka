	- Make sure the user can resume the video where they left off 
	- Build a user profile in real time 
	- Recommend the next show to the user in real time
  	- Store all the data in the anlaytics store

How to implement
----------------

Video Position & Resume:


	- Topic :
		-New topic -  Show Position
		- Is a topic that tells us how far users have consumed a TV show and within a video 
		- can have multiple producers
		- should be highly distributed if hugh volumes > 30 parttions
		- If I were to choose a key , I would choose "user_id" which would be the partioning key

	_ Producer:
		- Video Position Service
			- While video is playing ( browser/tv etc.) , it will once in  awhile send data to the thsi producer
			- this producer will send the data from Kafka , to show the position 
			


	- Consumer:
		- REsuming Service:
			- Will consume from the 'Show Position' topic 
			- Video player will request from the Resuming Service to get position  



REcommnedations:
		
	- Topic:
		-From existing topic 'Show Position' we already know shich user is watching which show from which position
		  - We thus know what the user likes and whether they go all the way to end of a show or watch 5 mins and never go back
	
		- New Topic : Recommendation 
				- Feeds back to the Portal/Website
				- Maybe  alow volume topic( there is not goingto be recommendation every 30 secs) 
				- If I were to choose a key it woul dbe user_id


	- Kafka Stream:
		- Recommendation Engine in real time 
			- takes data from topic  existing topic 'Show Position' and computes recommendations
			- writes recommendations to new topic 'Recommendation
			
			

	- Kafka Connect:
		- Analytics consmer : which will put all the computed data in an Analytics Store ( like Hadooop)
