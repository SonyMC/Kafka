Kafka Command Line Interface 
----------------------------


Intro:
- Come bundled with Kafka binaries
- If you have setup the $PATH variable correctly in WSL, then you should be able to invoke the CLI from anywhere on your computer
- kafka topics : 
	- Create, Delete, describe or change a topic
- If you have installed using Kafka binaries:
		- cmds should end in .sh:
			- E.g:
				- kafka-topics.sh(Linux, MAC, Windows)
				- kafka-topics.bat(Windows non WSL2)
		- For homebrew. apt..
			- E.g; 
				- kafka-topics

- Use the --bootstrap-server option everywhere, not --zookeepers
		- This is because zookeeper is being decomissioned
		- So we will be using cmd: kafka-topics --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
				- We will not be using zookeeper cmd: kafka-topics --zookeeper localhost:2181 ( even if this will work) 
		

- Errors
	- $PATH has not been set correctly
			- one work around is to use the full path to the Kafka binaries
			- E.g. cmd: ~/kafka_2.13-3.0.0/bin/kafka-topics.sh 


	- WINDOWS NON-WSL2 USERS PLEASE READ( not applicable to our demo):
		- do not run the command to DELETE topics
		- Because of a bug here: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-1194, it doesn't work.
		- In the meantime, please do not delete topics. Otherwise, your Kafka will crash and you won't be able to do the tutorial.
