Kafka Streams
-------------

Intro:

- You want to do the following from the wikimedia.recentchange topic:
		- Count the number of times a change was created by a bot versus a human	
		- Analyze number of changes per website ( ru.wikipedia.org vs e.wikipedia.org)
		- No. of edits per 10s as a time series
		

- We can achieve the above by suign a Producer/Consumer but that's low level and not developer firendly 

- Instead we can use a Kafka Streams application 

- Objective:
	- Kafka Streams applicaiton will read from teh topic wikimedia.recentchange
	- The app will then output the stats for teh bots, website and timeseries
