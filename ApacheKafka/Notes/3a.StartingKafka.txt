- Install WSL2
	- Option 1:
		- Start Kafka using COnduktor
		- Install Kafka CLI tools using Binaries on WSL2
	- Option 2:
		-Install Kafka CLI tools using Binaries on WSL2
		- Start Kafka using Binaries on WSL2

_ Refer 'Install+Kafka+Diagram.pdf' for installing Kafka on other platforms




-Conduktor
-----------------------------
- Easiest way is to use Conduktor to start  kafka
	- 
- Free for all platforms
- Has an UI 



Installation
---------------
- url: localhost(127.0.0.1)
- Natively: we will use native Kafka binaries from the website
- With One Broker and (optionally) ONE Zookeeper only(perfect for development)
- Note: The production-ready Kafka cluster setup takes over 4 hours and we will not be doing this now.

FAQ
----
=====================

> Zookeeper - java.net.BindException: Address already in use

Something is already occupying your port 2181. Figure out which application it is and stop it

> Kafka - org.apache.kafka.common.KafkaException: Socket server failed to bind to 0.0.0.0:9092: Address already in use.

Something is already occupying your port 9092. Figure out what it is and stop it.
Otherwise, if you really insist, you can change the Kafka port by adding the following line to server.properties

# example for port 9093
listeners=PLAINTEXT://:9093
> My topics are losing their data after a while

This is how Kafka works. Data is only retained for 7 days.

> The topics list is disappearing

Make sure you have changed the Zookeeper dataDir=/path/to/data/zookeeper , and Kafka log.dirs=/path/to/data/kafka

> I have launched Kafka in a VM or in the Cloud, and I can't produce to Kafka

If you can't produce to Kafka, it's possible you are using a VM and this can break the Kafka behaviour. Please look at the annex lectures for solutions of how to deal with that. I strongly recommend doing this tutorial using the Kafka binaries and localhost
