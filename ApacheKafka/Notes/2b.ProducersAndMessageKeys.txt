Producers and Message Keys
----------------------------



Producers:
---------
- Producers write data to topics( which are made of partitions)
- Producers know whch partition to write to( and which Kafka broker(which is a Kafka Server) has it)
- In case of Kafka broker failures, Producers will automatically recover 
- The load is balanced to many brokers( servers) thanks to the no. of partitions

Producers: message Keys
---------------------------
- Producers can choose to send a key with the message( string, number, binarty etc.) 
- If key= null, data is sent round robin( i.e partiion 0, then 1, then 2, ...)
		- This is how load balancing is achieved
- If key != null, then all messages for that key will go to the same partition ( hashing)
- A key is typically sent if you need message ordering for a specific field( E.g. truck_id)
- ***Important: A partition can hold data for multiple keys, but a particular key will always belong to one parttion.   


Kafka Messages Anatomy
-------------------------
(1) Key(binary) - Can be null
(2) Value(binary) -Is the message content and can be null
(3)Compression type -
		- none,gzip, snappy, lz4, zstd
(4)Headers(Optiona)
	-List  Key, value pairs
(5) Parttion + Offset
(6)Timestamp:
	- System or User Set)

Kafka Message Serializer
---------------------------
- Kafka only accepts bytes as an input from producers and sends bytes out as an output to consumers
- Message Serialization: means transforming objects.data inot bytes
- They are used on the value and the key
	- E.g:
		- Key object = 123, Value Object = "Hello World"
		- We can specify the Key Serializer as an Integer Serializer
			- Key Serilaizer converts the Key Object( 123) to binary
 		- We can specify the Value Serializer as a Strign Serializer
			- Value Serializer converts teh value( Object( Hello World) to binary
- Common Serializers:
	-  String, Int , Float, Avro, Protobuf etc.

Kafka Message Key Hashing
----------------------------
- Kafka partitioner : 
		- is  a code logic that takes a record and determines to which partition to send it inot
- Key Hashing:
		- is the process of determining the mapping of a key to a partition 

- In the default Kafka partitioner, the keys are hashed using the murmur2 algorithm, with the formula below for the curious:
	- targetPartition =   Maths.abs(Utils.murmur2(keyBytes)) % ( numPartiones - 1)
