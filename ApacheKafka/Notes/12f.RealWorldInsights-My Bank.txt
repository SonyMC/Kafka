My Bank 
------------------

- Is a company that allows real time banking. The business want to deploy a barnd new capability to alert users in case of large transactions:
	- The transaction data already exists in DB 
	- Threshholds can be defined by users
	- Alerts must be sent in real time to the users





How to implement
---------------


- New Topic : 
	-Bank_transactions 
	-User_Settings
	-User_Alerts

	
		
	
	 


- Producer:
	- App_Threshold_Service  :  sends threshhold data from user app to topic ' Bank_transactions'



-Kafka Stream:
	- Real time Big Transaction Detection: 	
		- takes data from topics 'Bank_transactions ', 'User_Settings' and computes aggregations and writes to topic  'User_Alerts'	



- Consumer: 
	- Notification Service:
		- takes data from topic 'User_Alerts' and sends it to user app

- Kafka Connect:
	- Kafka Connect Source CDC Connector(Debezium):
		- CDC is Change Data Capture
		- One of the CDC flavous is Debezium
		- Allows us to reald all the transactions in real time from the DB and put them in Kafka in a nice format
		- Very powerful 
		- Connects to DB of transactions and sends data to the topic 'BanK_transactions' 

- Events:
	- It is better to sned events to the topic( E.g. User 123 enabled threshhold at $1000 at 12 pm on JUly 12th, 2018) rather than sending teh state of the user( E.g. User 123: threshhold $1000)
