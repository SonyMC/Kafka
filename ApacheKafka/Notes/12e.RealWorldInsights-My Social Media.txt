- Is a company that allows people topost images and others to react by using "likes" and "comments". The business want the following capabilites:
	- Users should be able to post, like and comment 
	- Users should be able to see total no. of likes and coments per post in real time 
	- High volume of data is expected on the first day of launch
	- Users should be able be able to see trending posts




How to implement
---------------


- New Topic : 
	-Posts 
	-Likes 
	-Comments
	- Posts_With_Counts
	- Trending Posts
	
		
	
	 


- Producer:
	- Posting Service  :  which sends posts to the topic ' posts' 
	- Like/Comment Service : 	sends likes and comments to topics 'Likes' & topic 'Comments'
						- is a producer tat writes to 2 different topics	


-Kafka Stream:
	- Total Likes/Comments Computation: 	
		- takes data from topics 'Posts', 'Likes', and 'Comments' and computes aggregations and writes to topic  'Posts_With_Counts'	
	- Trending Posts in the past hour:
		- takes data from topics 'Posts', 'Likes', and 'Comments' and computes aggregations and writes to topic  'Trending Posts'

- Consumer: 
	- Refresh_Feed_Consumer :
		- takes data from topic 'posts_with_counts' and publish to a website

- Kafka Connect:
	- Trending Feed Service:
		-  takes data from topic 'posts_with_counts' and publish to a website


CQRS model:
	- The above architectural model is called CQRS( Command, Query REsponsibilty Segregations) as it decouples all Commands, Queries and Reads which would enable scalability
	- REsponsibilites are segregated

Events:
	- The data in Kafka should be formatted as events:
		- E.g. 
			- User_123 created a post_id 456 at 2 pm 
			- User_234 liked post_id 456 at 3 pm 
			- USer_123 deleted a post_id 456 at 6 pm
