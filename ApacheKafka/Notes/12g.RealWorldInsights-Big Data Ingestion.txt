Big Data Ingestion 
------------------

- It is common to have "generic" connectors or solutions to offload data from Kafka to HDFS, Amazon S3, and Elastic Search etc.
-It is also very common to have KAfka serve a "speed layer" for real tiem applications, while having a a "slow layer"  which helps with data ingestions into stores for later analystics
- Kafka as a front to Big Data Ingestion is a very common pattern in Big Data to provide an "ingestion buffer" in front of some stores
- Speed Layer:
	- Use Kafka Connect for Spark, Storm, Flink etc. which in turn send data to Real Time analystics, Dashboard alerts and apps/consumers
- Slow Layer:
	- Use Kafka Connect for Hadoop, Amazon S3, RDBMS etc,. which will in tun send data to Data Science, Reporting, Audit , Backup/ Storage etc.
	- Used for Data Sceince, REporting , Ausits or just for long term storage
