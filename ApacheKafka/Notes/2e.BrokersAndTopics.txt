Brokers And Topics
---------------------


Kafka Brokers
-----------
- A Kafka cluster is composed of multiple brokers( servers)
- Each broker is identified with its ID(integer)
- Each Broker contains certain topic parttions
- After connecting to any broker( called a bootstrap broker), you will be connected to the entire cluster(Kafka clients have smart mechanics for that)
- A good number to get started is 3 brokers, but some big clusters have  over 100 brokers


Brokers and Topics
--------------------
- Example of Topic-A with 3 partitions and Topic-B with 2 partitioons
- 3 brokers: Broker 101, 102 & 103
- Broker 101:
	- Topic A , Partion 0
	- Topic B,  Partion 1
	
- Broker 102:
	- Topic A , Partion 2
	- Topic B,  Partion 0
- Broker 101:
	- Topic A , Partion 0


- Note: 
	- Data is distributed
	- Broker 103 doesn't have any Topic B data

Kafka Broker Discovery
----------------------
- Each Kafka broker is called a "bootstrap server"
- This means you need to connect to only one broker , and the Kafka clients will know how to be connected to the entire cluster(smart clients)
- Once the Kafka client intiates a successful coneection to any one broker, it gets as response list of all brokers and topics
- Client can connect to any broker it wants
 
	
- Broker 103:
	- Topic A , Partion 1
