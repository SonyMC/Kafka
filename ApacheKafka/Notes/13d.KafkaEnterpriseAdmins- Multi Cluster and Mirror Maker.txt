- Kafka can only operate well in a single region
- Therefore it is very common for enterproses to have Kafka clusters across the world, with some level of replication between them 
- A relication at it's core is just a consumer+producer
- There are different tools to perfom replication:
	- Mirror Maker 2 - open-source Kafka connector that ships with Kafka
	- Netflix uses Flink - they wrote their own application 
	- Uber uses uReplicator - addresses performance and operations issues with Mirror Maker 1
	- Comcast has their own open-source Kafka Connect Source
	- Confluent has their own Kafka Connect Source(paid)
	

- Overall, try these and see if it works for your use case before writing your own

- Replication doensn't preserve offsets, just data. Data at an offset in one cluster is not the same as data at teh same offset in another cluster.

- KAfka Multi Cluster & Replication - Active/Active
--------------------------------------------------
	- 2 Kafka clusters with producer/consumers operatign locally
	- Both clusters canbe read/written to
	- A 2 way replication can be setup between teh 2 clusters
	- Advantages:
		- Ability to serve users from a nearby Data center, which typically has performance benefits
		- REdundancy and Resilience: Since every data center has all teh functionality , if one data center is unavailable you can direct users to a remaining data center.
	- Disadvantages:
		- The main drawback of this architecture is the challenges in avoiding conflicts when data is read and updated asynchronlusly in multiple locations



- KAfka Multi Cluster & Replication - Active/Passive
--------------------------------------------------------------
	- 2 Kafka clusters with one one having a producer/consumer operatin locally & the other having only a consumer
	- Data is only replicated in one cluster
	- Advantages:
		- Simplicity in setup and that it can used in all use cases
		- No need to worry about access to data, handling conflicts , and other architectural complexities
		- Good for cloud migrations as well
	- Disadvantages:
		- Waste of a good cluster as it will be only used for reads
		- The fact that it is currently not possible to perform cluster failover in Kafka without eithe rlosing data or having duplicate events
