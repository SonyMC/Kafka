Consumer Offset Behaviour
-------------------------------------

- A consumer is expected to read from a log continusly
- A consumer can be down in case of a bug
- By default. Kaka has a retention of 7 days , and if your consumer is down for more than 7 days, teh offsets are invlid
- The behaviour for the cosumer ids then to then use:
	- auto.offset.rest=latest 
			- will read 	from the end of the log 
	- auto.offset.reset=earliest
			- will read from teh start of the log
	- auto.offset.reset=none
			- will throw exception if no offset is found

- Additionally, consumer offsets can be lost:
	- If a consumer hasn't read new data in 1 day( KAfka < 2.0)  - default
	- If a consumer hasn't read new data in 7 days( KAfka >= 2.0) - default

- This can be controlled by the broker setting offset.retention.minutes 






Replaying data for Consumers
-------------------------------
- To replay data for a consumer group:
 	- Take all consumers from a specific group down 
	- Use kafka-consumer-groups command to set offset to what you want 
	 

Bottom Line
-------------
	- Set proper data retention period & offset retention period
	- Ensure the auto reset bahavious is the oe you expect/want
	- Use replay capability in case of unexpected behaviour
