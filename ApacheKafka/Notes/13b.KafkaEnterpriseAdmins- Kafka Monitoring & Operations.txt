- Kafka exposes metrics through JMX( an interface to get hese metrics)
- These metrics are highly important for monitoring Kafka, and ensuring the systems are behaving correctly under load 
- Common places to host the Kafka metrics:
	- ELK( ELasticSearch + Kibana)
	- Datadog
	- Confluent Control Center
	- Prometheus

- Some important metrics:
	- Under Replicated partitions: No of partittions that are in problem with ISR( in sync replicas) . May indicate a high load on the system
	- Request Handlers: utilzation of threads for IO, NW, etc. Overall utilization of an Apache Kafka broker
	- Request Timing: how long it takes to reply to requests. Lower is better, as latency will eb improved



Kafka Operations:
	- Kafka Operations team must be able to perform teh following tasks:
		- Rolling REstart of Brokers
		- Updating Configurations
		- REbalancing parttions
		- Increasing replication factor
		- Adding a Broker
		- Replacing a Broker
		- Upgrading a Kafka CLuster with zero downtime
