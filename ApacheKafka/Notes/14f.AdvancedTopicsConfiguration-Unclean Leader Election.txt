Unclean Leader Election
-----------------------------

unclean.leader.election.enable

- In case all your in sync replicas go offline( but you still have out of sync replicas up), you have the following option
	- You can wait for an ISR to come back online(default)
	- Alternatively, you can set unclean.leader.election.enable= true
				- non ISR parttion becomes the leader
				- and start producing to non ISR partitions
				- improves availbility, but you will lose data because other messages on the ISR will be discarded when they come back online and relicate data from the new leader
				- overall this is a reisky setting, and its implcations must be undertood fully before enabling it.s

Use case: 
	- metrics collection, log collection and other use cases where data loss is somewhat acceptable, at the trade-off of availibility
