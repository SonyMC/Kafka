Consumer REplica Fetching - Rack Awareness
----------------------------------------------

Default Consumer Behaviour with PArtition Leaders:
	- Kafka consumers by default will read from leader broker for a partittion
	- Possibly higher latency( multiple data center) + higher NW charges($$$)

- Since Kafka 2.4, it is possible to configure consumers to read from the closest replica
- This may improve latency and decrease cloud NW closts


Consumer Rack Awareness( v2.4+) - How o setup:
	- Broker setting:
		- must be version >= 2.4
		- rack.id must be set to the data center id( E.g. AZ ID in AWS)
			- E.g of AWS: AZ ID rack.id=usw2-az1
		- replica.selector.class mus tbe set to 
				org.apache.kafka.common.replica.RackReplicaSelector
	= Consumer client setting:
		- Set client.rack to the data center ID teh consumer is launched on
