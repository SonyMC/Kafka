Kafka Cluster Setup - High Level Architecture Overview
-----------------------------------------------------

- You want multiple brokers in diffeent Data Centres( racks) to distribute your load.You also want a cluster of atleast 3 Zookeeper( if you are using Zookeeper)


Notes:
	- Its not easy to setup a cluster
	- You want to isolate each Zookeeper & Broker on seprate servers
	- You also need to implment monitoring
	- Operations must be mastered
	- You need an excellent Kafka admin 
 
	- Alternative:
		- managed "Kafka as a Service" offerings from various companies
			- Amazon MSK< Cnflunetn Cloud, Aiven, CloudKarafka, Instaclustr, Upstash, etc.
			- No operational burdens(updates, monitoring, setup etc.)


 	- How many brokers:
		- Compute your throughput, data retention and replication factor
		- Then test for your use case


	- Other components that you need to setup:
		- Kafka Connect clusters
		- Kafka Schema Registtry: make sure to run two for high availbility
		- UI tools for ease of administration 
		- Admin tools for automated workflows
		- Automate as much as you can your infrastructure when you have understood how processes work
