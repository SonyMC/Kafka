Choosing Parttion Count & Replication Factor
--------------------------------------------
- 2 most parameters when creating a topic
- They impact performance and durability of the system overall

- It is best to get the parameters right the first time:
	- If the partitions count increases during a topic lifecycle, you will break your keys ordering guarentees
	- If the replication factor increases during a topic lifecycle, you put more pressure on your cluster, which can lead to unexpected performance decrease( due to increased N/W bad and disk space use) 


Partitions Count
-----------------------------
	- Each partition can handle a throughput of a few MB/s(measure it for your setup)
	- More parttions implies:
		- Better parallelism,better throughput
		- Ability to run more consumers in a group to scale(max as many consumers per group as partitions)
		- Ability to leverage more brokers if you have a large cluster
		- But more elections to perform for Zookeeper(if suing Zookeeper)
		- But more files opened on Kafka


Guidelines for setting Parttion Count
-------------------------------------------
- Partitions per topic = Million Dollar Question
	- (Intuition) Small Cluster ( < 6 brokers)  : 3 x # brokers
	- (Intuition) Big Cluster   ( > 12 brokers) : 2 x # brokers  
	- Adjust for no. of consumers you need to runin parallel at peak throughput
	- Adjust for producer throughput( increase if super-high throughput or projected increase in the next 2 years)
	- Test:  every Kafka cluster will have different performance
	- Don't systematically create topics wih 1000 parttions.




 Replication Factor:
---------------------

	- Should be alteast 2, usually 3, maximum 4
	- Higher the replication factor(N):
		- Better durability of your system( N-1 brokers can fail)
		- Better availability of your system( N-min,insync.replicas if producer acks=all)
		- But Higher repliation ( higher latency if acks = all)
		- But more disk space onyour system(50% more if RF is 3 instead of 2)

 
Guidelines for setting REplication Factor
-------------------------------------------
- Set it to 3 to get started( you must have atleast 3 brokers for that)
- If replication performance is an issue, get a better broker instead of less RF
- Never set to 1 in prod


Cluster Guildelines
----------------------
- Total no. of partitions in the cluster:
	- Kafka with Zookeeper:
		- max. 200,000 parttions( Nov 2018) - Zookeeper Scaling limit
		- still recommended a max. of 400,000 parttiosn per broker ( soft limit) 
	- KAfka with KRaft:
		- potentially millions of parttions

- If you need more than 200,000 partttiosnin your cluster ( it will take time to get there), follow the Netflix model and create more Kafka clusters.  

- Overall , you don't need a topic with 1000 parttions to achieve high throughput.
Start at a reasonable number and test the performance.
