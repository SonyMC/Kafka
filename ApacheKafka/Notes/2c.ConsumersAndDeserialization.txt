Consumers and Deserialization
--------------------------------

- Consumers read data from a topic(identified by name) - pull model
- A Consumer can read from one topic and can use multiple topic partitions
- One Topic can have multiple consumers
- Consumers automatically know which broker to read from 
- In case of broker failures, consumers know how to recover
- Data is read in order from low to high offset within each parttionss

Consumer Deserializer
----------------------
- Deserialize indicates how to transform bytes into objects/data
- They are used on the value and the key of the message
- E.g. 
	- Key = binary
		- Apply Key Deserializer = Integer Deserializer to get Key Object 
	- Value = binary 
		- Apply Value Deserializer = String Deserializer to get Value Object

- Common Deserializers:
	- String, Int. Float, Avro, Protobuf etc.

- The serialization/deserialization type must not change during topic lifecycle( create a new topic instead)
