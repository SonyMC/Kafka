Advanced Topics Configuration - PArttions and Segments
-------------------------------------------------------

- Topics are made of parttions
- Partitions are made of segments(files)
- Each segment contains a range of Offsets
- Active Segment : 
	- Is the last segment in a partition which is being written to
	- A prttion can have only one active segment
- 2 important segment settings:
	- log.segment.bytes:
		- is the maximum size of a single segment in bytes( default is 1 GB)
			- This means that is teh segment sze exceeds 1 GB, teh current segment will eb closed and a new one will be created.

		- smaller log.segment.bytes means: 
			- More segments per parttions
			- Log compaction happens more often
			- But Kafka must keep more files opened( Error: To omany open files)
		
	- log.segment.ms:
			
			- The time Kafka will wait before committing the segment if not full( 1 week)

			- This denotes teh time that KAfka will wait before closing the segment( regardless of the size)

			- smaller log.segment.ms maeans
				- You set a max frequency for log compaction(more often triggers)
				- Maybe you require a daily compaction instead of weekly


- Indexes:
	- Segments come along with 2 indexes(files):
		- An offset to position index: helps Kafka find where to read from and to find a message
		- A timestamp to offset index: helps Kafka find messages with a specific timestamp
