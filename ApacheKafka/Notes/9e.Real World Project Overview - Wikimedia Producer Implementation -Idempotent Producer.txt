Wikimedia Producer - Idempotent Producer
-----------------------------------------

- The Producer can introduce duplicate messages in Kafka due to N/W errors
- In Kafka >=0.11, you can define an "idempoten producer", which won't introduce duplicates on N/W error 
	- Kafka is smart to enough to recognize the duplicate and does not commit teh duplicate, but sends a succes ack to producer 
  
- Idempotent producers are great to guarantee a stable and safe pipeline
- They are default since Kafka 3.0, recommended to use them

- They come with:
	- retries=Integer.MAX_VALUE(2^31 -1) 
	- max.in.flight.requests=1(Kafka==0.11) 
			OR
	
       max.in.flight.requests=5(Kafka>=1.0 - higher performance & keep orderig - KAFKA-5494)
	- acks=all

- These settings are appied automatically after your producer has started ii not manually set
- Manual setting:
	- producerProps.put("enable.idempotence", true)
