Producer Acknowledgment and Topic Durability
---------------------------------------------


Producer Acknowledgement
------------------------
- Producers can choose to recieve acknowledgments of data writes 
	(1) acks=0:
		- Producer won't wait for acknowledgement(possible data loss)
	(2) acks=1
		- Producer will wait for leader acknowledgement(limited data loss) 
	(3) acks=all
		- Producer will wait for leader+replicas acknowledgement( no data loss)



Kafka Topic Durability
-------------------------
- For a topic replication factor of 3, topic data durability can withstand 2 brokers loss
- As a rule, for a Replication Factor of N, you can permanently lose upto N-1 brokers and still recover your data
