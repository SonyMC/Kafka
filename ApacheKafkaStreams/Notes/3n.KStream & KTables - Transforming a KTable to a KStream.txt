KStream & KTable

Transforming a KTable to a KStream
------------------------------------

- It is sometimes helpful to transform a KTable to a KStream in order to keep a changelog of all the changes to the Ktable.
- This can easily be achieved as follows:

KTable<byte[], String> table = ....;

// Also a variant of 'toStream' exists that allow you 
// to select a new key for the resulting stream 
KStream<byte[], String> stream = table.toStream();
