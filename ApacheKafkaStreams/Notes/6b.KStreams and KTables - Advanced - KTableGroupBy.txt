KTable Group By
----------------
	- GroupBy allows yo to perform more aggregations within a KTable
	- We have used it in the previous section during our Favourite Colour Example
	- It triggers a reparttion because the key changes
	- E.g:
		- KGroupedTable<String,Integer> groupedTable = table.groupBy(
			(key,value) -> KeyValue.pair(value, value.length()),
			Serdes.String(), /* key ( note: type was modified) */
			Serdes.Integer() /* value (note: type was modified) */ );
