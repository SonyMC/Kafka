KStream & KTable
Stateless vs Stateful Operations
--------------------------------

- Stateless:
	- means that the result of the trasnsformaiton only depends on the data-point you proces
		- E.g: "multiply a value by 2" operation is stateless because it doesn't need memory of the past to be achieved
		

- Stateful:
	- means that the result of the transformation also depends on an external information - the state  
	- E.g: a count operation is stateful becuase your app needs to know what happened since it started running in order to know the computation result
