WordCount - Internal Topics
-------------------------------

- Running a Kafka Streams may eventually create internal intermediary topics
- Two types:
	- Repartioning topics: 
		- In case you start transforming the key of your stream, a repartitioning will happen at some processor
	- Changelog topics:
		- In case you perform aggregations, Kafka Streams will save compacted data in these topics

- Internal topics:
	- Are managed by KAfka Streams
	- Are used by Kafka Streams to save/restore and re-parttion data
	- Are prefixed by application.id parameter
	- Should never be deleted, altered or published to. They are internal.
