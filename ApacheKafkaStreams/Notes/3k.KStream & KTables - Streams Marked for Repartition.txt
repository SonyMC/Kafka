KStream & KTable
Stream Marked for Reparttion
----------------------------
- As soon as an operation can possibly change the key, the stream will be marked for reparttion:
	- Map
	- FlatMap
	- SelectKey

- So only us these APIs if you need to change the key, otherwise use their counterparts:
	- MapValues
	- FlatMapValues
 - Repartitoning is done seamlessly behind the scenes but will incur a performance cost( read and write to Kafka)
