Objectives
----------

- Scala:
	- Is a programmign language that also runs on the JVM and heavily relies on JAva
	- Som epeople use Scala already beacuse it well suited for Big Data Analysis, and is used on popular frameworks like Spark or Scalding
	- 

- Take a cooma delimited topic of userid, colour
	- Filter out bad data
	- Keep only colour of "green", "red", "blue"
- Get the running count of the favourite colurs overall and output this to a topic
- Note : A user's favourite colour can change 
	- E.g. 
		- Stephane, Blue 
		- John, Green
		- Stephane, Red( update)
		- Alicce , Red

	- Colour count for the above E.g. should be:
		- Blue = 0
		- Green -= 1
		- Red = 2

- To do:
	- Write topology
	- Start finding the right transformations to apply
	- Create input and output topics( and intermediary topics if you think on any)
	- Feed the sample data as a producer:
		- stephane, blue
		- john, green
		- stephane, red
		- alice, red


- Notes:
	- The input data does not have keys but represents updates
		- We should read it as a KStream and extract the key
		- We should write the result to Kafka ( as a log compacted topic)
	- The results can now be read as a KTable so that updates are correctly applied
	- We can now perform an aggregation on the kTable(groupBy then count)
	- And write the results back to Kafka


- Topology and Operations:
	(1) Read one topic from Kafka( KStream)
	(2) Filter bad values
	(3) SelectKey that will be the user id
	(4) MapValues to extract the colour( a slowercase)
	(5) Filter to remove bad colours
	(6) Write to Kafka as an intermediary topic
	(7) Read from Kafka as a KTable(Ktable)
	(8) GroupBy Colours
	(9) Count to count colours occurences(KTable)
	(10)Write to Kfka as a final topic


Starter Project Setup
-----------------------
- We will create a starter project with the required maven dependecies
	- Kafka Stream Client
	- Logging Libraries ( log 4j)
	- Maven plugins







Code reference:
	- favourite-colour-scala
		- D:\OneDrive\Study\DevOps\Kafka\ApacheKafkaStreams\Refer\kafka-streams-course-2.0.0\favourite-colour-scala


build.sbt:
	- Is the maven POM file equivalnet for Scala
	- After adding dependencies, click on icon for loading changes

resources/log4


- Setup log4j.properties
	- src/main/resources

-Main class:
	-FavouriteColourAppScala.scala


Note: Thsi does not work for me.
