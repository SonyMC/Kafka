KStream
Branch
----------

- Branch(split) a KStream based on one or more predicates
- Predicates are evaluated in order, if no matches, records are dropped
- You get multiple KStreams as a result


E.g:
KStream<String,Long>[] branches = stream.branch(
	(key,value) -> value > 100, /* first predicate */
	(key,value) -> value > 10 , /* second predicate */
	(key,value) -> value > 0    /* third predicate */
);
