What is exactly once?
	- Exactly once is the ability to guarantee that data processing on each message will happen only once , and that pushing the message back to Kafka will also happen effectively only once( Kafka will de-dup)
	- Guaranteed when booth I?P and O/P system is Kafka( not for Kafka to external systems)
	- You can only get Exactly Once Semantics if your Kafka brokers are of version >=0.11 and your Kafka Streams Client is of version >= 0.11
	


When does the problem arises?
	- Refer picture 'AtLeastOnceProblem.jpg'

How does Kafka 0.11 solve teh problem?
	-Refer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo9jlaz8h0k&t=1s
	- Without getting into too much engineering details:
		- The producers are now idempotent(if the same message is sent twice or more due to retries, Kafka wil lmake sure to only keep one copy of it).
		- You can write multiple messages to different Kafka topics as part of one transaction(either all are written, or none are written), This is a new advanced API.
		- To achieve this they had to change some logic and the internal message format in Kafka 0.11, therefore only thsi broker and client version can achieve it
		- You will ony have to use libraries that implment the new API:
			- Kafka Streams
 


Problem with AtLeast Once Semantics:
	- Cases where it is not acceptable to have atleast once
		- Getting the exact count by key for a stream
		- Summing up the bank transactions to compute a persion's bank balance
		- Any operation that is not idempotent
		- Any finacial computation

	- Cases where it's acceptable to have atleast once:
		- Operations on time windows(because the time itself can be vague)
		- Approximate operations(countign the number of times an IP hits a webpage to detect attacks and webscraping)
		- Idempotent operations( max, min, etc.)

How to do exactly once in KAfka Streams:
	- One additional line of code:
		Properties prop = new Properties();
		...
		props.put(StreamsConfig.PROCESSING_GUARANTEE_CONFIG, StreamConfig.EXACTY_ONCE);
		...
		KafkaStreams streams = new KafkaStreams(builder, props);

- Currently , Kafka Streams 	is the only library that has implmented this feature, but it is possible that Spark, Flink and othe rframeowrks implement it in the future too.


Cons:
	- Results are published in transactions, which might incur a small latency
	- You fine tune that settign using commit.interval.ms
