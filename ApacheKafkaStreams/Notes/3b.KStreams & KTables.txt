KStreams 
---------------------
- Refer Diagram : KStream.jpg
- All inserts
- Similar to a log
- Infinite
- Unbounded data Streams



KTables
-------
- Refer Diagram : KTable.jpg
- All upserts( update and inserts) on non null values
- Deletes on null values
- Similar to a table
- Parallel with log compacted topics 


KStream vs KTable
---------------------
- KStream reading from a topic that's not compacted
- KTable reading from a topic tha's log-compacted(aggregations)

- KStream if new data is partial information/transactional
- KTable more if you need a structure that's like a "database table" , where every update is self sufficient( think - total bank balance)
