KStream
Writing To Kafka
------------------

- You can write any KSream or KTable back to Kafka
- If you write a KTable back to Kafka, think about screating a log compacted topic.

- To: Terminal Opertion - write records to a Topic
	- E.g. 
		stream.to("my-stream-poutput-topic");
		table.to("my-table-output-topic");

- Through: write to a topic and get a stream/table from the topic
	- E.g. 
		KStream<String, Long> newStream = stream.through("user-clicks-topic");
		KStream<String, Long> newTable  = table.through("my-table-output-topic");
