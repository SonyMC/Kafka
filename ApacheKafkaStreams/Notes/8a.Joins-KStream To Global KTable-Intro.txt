- Join:
	- Joining means taking a KStream and/or KTable and creating a new KStream or KTable from it
	- There are 4 kinds of joins(SQL like) and the most common one will be analyzed in a further section, including behaviour and usage
	- Possible combinations:
		- Refer picture: 'Joins-KStreams and KTables.jpg'
				- Note: Type= Windowed means doing the join within a specific time window

	- E.g. We will be demoing:
		- kStream to GlobalKTable
			- Type = Non-Windowed
			- Supported OPerations = (inner) join, left join and outer join
