WordCount : Printing the KAfka Streams Topology
-----------------------------------


Tip: In iIntellIj, to see return type of an expression, use ctrl+shift+P

- Printing the topology at teh start of the application is helpful while developing ( and even in production) as it helps understand the application flow directly from the first lines of the logs
- Reminder : The topology represents all teh streams and procesors of your Streams application
