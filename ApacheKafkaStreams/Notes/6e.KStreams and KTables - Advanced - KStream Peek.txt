KStream Peek
------------

- Peek allows you to apply a side-effect operation to a kStream and get the same KStream as a result
- A side effect could be:
	- printing the stream to the console
	- Statistics collection

- Warning:
	- It could be executed multiple times as it is a side effect in cas eof failures)
	

E.g:
KStream<byte[], String> Stream = ...;

// Java 8+ example, using lambda expressions
KStream<byte[], String> unmodifiedStream = stream.peek(
	(key,value) -> Stream.out.println("key" + key + ", value =' + value));
